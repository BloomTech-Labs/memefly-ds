## Project Overview

[Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/BLp7jI06/memefly)

[Product Canvas](https://www.notion.so/Memefly-4148c8ecbd3b4bcfb1c6624b2f28090d)

Automatic meme generation model using Tensorflow Keras. Model is Dockerized and served as a REST API with FastAPI/uvicorn ASGI endpoint. A separate serving model serving is done with a combination of FastAPI/uvicorn ASGI endpoint with models served using Tensorflow Serving on Sagemaker.

### Architecture
![memefly_architecture](./memefly-de/assets/memefly-ai-architect.png)

### Predictions

We used an encoder-decoder architecture for the meme generation task. Pre-trained Inception V3 architecture and weights are used as the encoder to extract embeddings from an input image. At the same time, we encode the texts into text embeddings and concat them together with image embeddings. For the decoder, we used GRU to to map the image and text embeddings to predict the next word in the text string. 

At training time, we repeat the same image embeddings as input and send in text sequences in order, e.g., 0. `this`, 1. `this is`, 2. `this is a`, 3. `this is a sequence`. The model will try to predict the next word in the sequence given the input image embedding and text embeddings. We denote the beginning and the end of a text sequence with `startseq` and `endseq`.

At inferencing time, we send in image embeddings and the seed token `startseq` to the model, and then repeatly send in the image embeddings and the prediction output of the previous timestep, until either we see `endseq` or reach maximum sentence length. To improve the quality of the output, we used beam search to greedily select the best N sentences. But it has to be noted that beam search is neither optimal nor complete algorithm.

To increase varieties, we tried 1) adding Guassian noise to the input image and 2) choosing top N sentence scores using beam search.

The architecture is summarized here:
